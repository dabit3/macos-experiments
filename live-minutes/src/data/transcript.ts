  [D, "Hi hi. Sharing my screen in a sec for the address form stuff.", "chit_chat"],
  [P, "Cool. Marcus, you want to kick off with the payment service migration?", "chit_chat"],

  [M, "Sure. So the migration to the new payments service is basically done, all the write paths are cut over.", "status_update"],
  [M, "Read paths are still going through the old service for about ten percent of traffic.", "status_update"],
  [P, "Any issues so far?", "open_question"],
  [M, "One thing, refund reconciliation is off by a few cents on some multi-currency orders.", "risk"],
  [M, "It's a rounding thing between the two services, not data loss, but finance will notice.", "risk"],
  [S, "Finance will definitely notice, they notice everything.", "chit_chat"],
  [P, "Marcus, can you write up the rounding discrepancy and send it to finance before end of day tomorrow?", "action_item", { a: M, dl: "specific_date" }],
  [M, "Yep, I'll have the write-up to finance by tomorrow.", "action_item", { a: M, dl: "specific_date" }],

  [P, "Great, Sofia has the currency table.", "chit_chat"],

  [P, "Okay, feature flag rollout. Where did we land on percentages?", "open_question"],
  [S, "My proposal was five percent tomorrow, twenty-five on Monday, then a hundred on launch day.", "status_update"],
  [M, "Five is fine. Twenty-five on Monday makes me a bit nervous with the reconciliation thing open.", "risk"],
  [D, "From a design side I don't care about percentages, as long as the new form is what people see.", "chit_chat"],
  [P, "Let's do five percent tomorrow and hold at five until the rounding issue is closed.", "decision"],
  [S, "Okay, so we hold at five until Marcus gives the all clear. That works.", "decision"],
  [M, "Sounds good.", "chit_chat"],
  [P, "Sofia, can you update the rollout doc with the new schedule?", "action_item", { a: S }],
  [S, "Will do, I'll update the rollout doc right after this.", "action_item", { a: S, dl: "specific_date" }],

  [S, "Drop-off on the shipping step is down a lot, that's the new address autocomplete doing its thing.", "status_update"],
  [D, "Told you the autocomplete would pay for itself.", "chit_chat"],

  [P, "Dev, you're up. Address form review.", "chit_chat"],

  [S, "How many users are under three twenty? Like, two?", "open_question"],
  [M, "It's more than you'd think, a lot of the older Android devices in the LATAM markets.", "status_update"],
  [D, "Right, so my proposal is B with a fallback to A below three sixty.", "status_update"],
  [P, "Fine by me. Let's go with B and the stacked fallback under three sixty.", "decision"],

  [D, "Cool. I'll have the final specs in Figma by Monday.", "action_item", { a: D, dl: "specific_date" }],

  [M, "Okay, can I raise something about webhooks?", "chit_chat"],
  [P, "Go ahead.", "chit_chat"],
  [M, "Stripe webhook retries. Our new endpoint isn't idempotent yet, so if Stripe retries we could double-record a payment.", "risk"],
  [S, "Double-record as in charge twice?", "open_question"],
  [M, "No, charge once, record twice. Which is still bad because the order history shows two payments.", "risk"],
  [P, "How big a fix is idempotency?", "open_question"],
  [M, "A day, maybe a day and a half. It's mostly adding the event ID as a unique key.", "status_update"],
  [P, "Okay. Marcus, make the webhook endpoint idempotent, that has to land before we go past five percent.", "action_item", { a: M, dl: "before_launch" }],
  [M, "Understood, idempotency before we widen the rollout.", "action_item", { a: M, dl: "before_launch" }],

  [P, "The plan says a hundred percent on October first.", "status_update"],
  [S, "Right, and that's a day late for the email. Can we go to a hundred on Tuesday instead?", "open_question"],
  [M, "If the reconciliation and idempotency stuff land next week, technically yes.", "status_update"],
  [P, "Okay, let's move the hundred percent to Tuesday the twenty-ninth then.", "decision", { rev: true }],
  [D, "Tuesday is tight for the final QA pass on the address form though.", "risk"],
  [P, "Hmm. Actually, no, let's not. Scrap Tuesday, we keep October first and marketing shifts the email a day.", "decision", { rev: true }],
  [S, "Okay, I'll go back to marketing and ask them to move the email to Thursday the first.", "action_item", { a: S }],
  [P, "Thanks. Sorry for the flip-flop.", "chit_chat"],

  [M, "Is anyone else's coffee machine on the third floor broken or is it just mine?", "chit_chat"],
  [D, "It's everyone's, it's been making that grinding noise since Monday.", "chit_chat"],
  [S, "I filed a facilities ticket, they said two to three business days, which I think is facilities speak for never.", "chit_chat"],
  [M, "Legendary.", "chit_chat"],
  [P, "Okay, okay, back to it. We've got fifteen minutes.", "chit_chat"],

  [S, "Legal. Has anyone heard back from legal about the new terms checkbox wording?", "open_question"],
  [P, "Not that I've seen.", "status_update"],
  [S, "Because if they want changes, Dev has to redo the review step and that's a design and a copy change.", "risk"],
  [D, "It's a small change but I'd rather know now than the day before launch.", "chit_chat"],
  [P, "Sofia, chase legal today and get a yes or no on the checkbox wording.", "action_item", { a: S, dl: "specific_date" }],
  [S, "On it, I'll ping the legal channel after standup.", "action_item", { a: S, dl: "specific_date" }],

  [P, "Are we? Marcus, is that in the new schema?", "open_question"],
  [M, "It's not. It's a column and a migration, I can add it.", "action_item", { a: M }],

  [D, "Oh, one more thing on my side, the iOS Safari bug.", "chit_chat"],
  [D, "The postcode field zooms the whole page when you focus it on iPhone. It's the sixteen pixel font-size thing.", "risk"],
  [M, "Classic. That's a one-line CSS fix.", "chit_chat"],
  [D, "One line but it's in the shared input component so it touches every form in the app.", "risk"],
  [P, "Is that in the launch scope or post-launch?", "open_question"],
  [S, "It has to be launch scope, iOS is forty percent of mobile checkout.", "decision"],
  [P, "Agreed, iOS zoom fix is in scope for launch.", "decision"],
  [P, "Dev, can you pair with Marcus on the input component change so we don't break the other forms?", "action_item", { a: D }],
  [D, "Yeah, I'll grab Marcus tomorrow morning for it.", "action_item", { a: D, dl: "specific_date" }],
  [M, "Works for me.", "chit_chat"],

  [P, "Let's do a quick pass on the end of quarter stuff since that's coming up.", "chit_chat"],
  [S, "The OKR review needs the checkout metrics doc. I'll get that written up by end of quarter.", "action_item", { a: S, dl: "end_of_quarter" }],
  [P, "And the cost report for the old payments service, we need that before we can decommission it.", "action_item", { a: null, dl: "none" }],
  [M, "I'll pull the cost numbers, but decommissioning the old service isn't happening this quarter, that's a Q4 thing.", "action_item", { a: M }],
  [P, "Agreed, decommission is Q4, we're not touching that before launch.", "decision"],
  [D, "Do we have a name for the old service yet or are we still calling it 'the old one'?", "chit_chat"],
  [M, "It's called payments-legacy in the repo, which is somehow more depressing.", "chit_chat"],

  [P, "Load testing. Marcus, where are we?", "open_question"],
  [M, "I ran a load test on Tuesday, five hundred checkouts a minute, everything held.", "status_update"],
  [M, "p99 latency on the payment call was about nine hundred milliseconds, which is fine, but the tax lookup was the slow part.", "status_update"],
  [S, "Black Friday is going to be more than five hundred a minute though.", "risk"],
  [M, "Yeah, we should test at two thousand. But the staging tax API rate-limits us above about eight hundred.", "risk", { blk: true }],
  [P, "Can we get a higher limit from the tax vendor?", "open_question"],
  [M, "I asked, they said they need a ticket from the account owner, which is Sofia.", "status_update", { blk: true }],
  [S, "Okay, I'll file the ticket with the tax vendor for a higher staging rate limit.", "action_item", { a: S }],
  [P, "And then Marcus reruns the load test at two thousand once the limit's raised.", "action_item", { a: M }],
  [M, "Yep, blocked on the vendor until then, but I'll run it as soon as the limit's up.", "action_item", { a: M, blk: true }],

  [S, "Support enablement. The support team needs a runbook for the new checkout before five percent goes live tomorrow.", "risk"],
  [P, "Who's writing that?", "open_question"],
  [S, "I started it but I don't know the failure modes well enough. Marcus, could you fill in the troubleshooting section?", "action_item", { a: M }],
  [M, "I can do the troubleshooting section tonight, it won't be pretty but it'll be accurate.", "action_item", { a: M, dl: "specific_date" }],
  [D, "I can add the screenshots of each step, I have them all from the Figma export anyway.", "action_item", { a: D }],
  [P, "Perfect. Runbook draft to support by tomorrow morning then.", "action_item", { a: null, dl: "specific_date" }],
  [S, "Yep, I'll send the runbook to support first thing tomorrow.", "action_item", { a: S, dl: "specific_date" }],

  [D, "Quick one, the accessibility audit came back on the new form.", "status_update"],
  [D, "Mostly fine, but the error messages on the card field aren't announced by screen readers.", "risk"],
  [S, "Is that a launch blocker? Legally I mean.", "open_question"],
  [P, "For the EU markets it kind of is, yes.", "risk"],
  [D, "It's an aria-live region, it's not hard, I just need someone on the frontend to wire it up.", "action_item", { a: null }],
  [M, "I can do the aria-live thing while I'm in the input component with you tomorrow.", "action_item", { a: M, dl: "specific_date" }],
  [P, "Good. Card field error announcements, Marcus and Dev, tomorrow.", "action_item", { a: M, dl: "specific_date" }],
  [D, "And I'll rerun the audit tool after so we have a clean report for the launch checklist.", "action_item", { a: D }],

  [S, "Promo codes. We found an edge case where a percentage code plus free shipping goes negative on tiny orders.", "risk"],
  [M, "Negative as in we pay the customer?", "open_question"],
  [S, "Negative as in the total shows minus forty cents and then the payment call fails.", "risk"],
  [P, "Let's just block stacking codes with free shipping for launch. Simplest fix.", "decision"],
  [S, "Hmm, marketing has a stacked promo planned for launch week though.", "risk"],
  [D, "There's also a design for the stacked codes already, it's in the review step.", "status_update"],
  [P, "Okay, forget blocking it. We keep stacking and clamp the total at zero instead.", "decision", { rev: true }],
  [M, "Clamp at zero is a two-line change, I'll do that with the idempotency work.", "action_item", { a: M }],
  [S, "And I'll tell marketing the stacked promo is safe to plan around.", "action_item", { a: S }],
  [P, "Good catch on that one, Sofia.", "chit_chat"],

  [D, "Sorry, that's my dog, someone's at the door.", "chit_chat"],
  [M, "Say hi to Biscuit.", "chit_chat"],
  [D, "Biscuit says hi and also please ship the address form.", "chit_chat"],
  [P, "Biscuit has the right priorities.", "chit_chat"],

  [P, "Monitoring. Do we have alerts on the new payment path or are we just staring at dashboards?", "open_question"],
  [M, "Dashboards only right now. There's no paging alert on payment failures.", "risk"],
  [P, "We need an alert on payment failure rate before tomorrow's five percent, that's non-negotiable.", "action_item", { a: null, dl: "specific_date" }],
  [M, "I'll set up the failure rate alert tonight along with the runbook section.", "action_item", { a: M, dl: "specific_date" }],
  [S, "Threshold? One percent? Two?", "open_question"],
  [P, "Let's go with two percent over five minutes to start, we can tighten it later.", "decision"],

  [M, "One blocker I should flag. The new service needs a secrets rotation before launch and that's owned by the infra team.", "risk"],
  [M, "I've had a ticket open with infra for a week and it's not moving.", "risk", { blk: true }],
  [P, "That's a launch blocker if it doesn't happen. I'll escalate to the infra lead today.", "action_item", { a: P, dl: "specific_date" }],
  [S, "Do we have a fallback if infra can't do it in time?", "open_question"],
  [M, "We could rotate them ourselves but it's against policy, so, not really.", "status_update"],
  [P, "Right, no, we're not doing that. I'll escalate. If there's no movement by Monday we raise it in the leadership sync.", "action_item", { a: P }],

  [P, "Okay, let's do a fast recap of owners so nothing falls through.", "chit_chat"],
  [P, "Marcus: rounding write-up to finance tomorrow, upsell event this week, webhook idempotency, flaky tests, terms column next sprint.", "status_update"],
  [M, "That's a lot of Marcus.", "chit_chat"],
  [P, "It is a lot of Marcus. Do you want to hand the flaky tests off?", "open_question"],
  [M, "Honestly, yeah, if someone else can take the flaky tests that would help.", "action_item", { a: null }],
  [D, "I'm not touching backend tests, sorry.", "chit_chat"],
  [P, "I'll take the flaky tests then, I miss writing code anyway.", "action_item", { a: P }],

  [P, "Sofia: currency table, rollout doc, support update, legal, marketing email, tax vendor ticket, runbook.", "status_update"],
